Gaw configuration files
======================

Gaw uses 2 configuration files.

The first one is specific to Gtk objects and is mandatory. A copy of it can
be found in the directory GAWRCDIR (/usr/local/share/gaw) after installation.
The contents of this file can be overriden by an instance of the file 
$HOME/.gaw/gaw-gtkrc where users are invited to put their preferences.
Info on the content an syntax of this file can be found
in GTK+ Reference Manual : Resource Files.

This file define colors for cursors, wave buttons, waves, DrawingAreas in
wavePanel, statusBar. Keep in mind that changing a color may imply others
changes. For example changing the DrawingArea background to white, will imply
changing the hightlight and srange color and may be the cursor color to make
then visible.

The second deals with application itself and is automaticaly created in the
file $HOME/.gaw/gawrc at first startup. Some variables can be changed from
inside the application, but others require that you use your favorite
text editor.
