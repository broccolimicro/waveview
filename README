Note : Fedora 13 : If you don't have icon in menu, run the command :
gconftool-2 --type boolean --set /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons true


See directory examples for example of different data file format.

Compiling:
We need :
  - Gtk+ libs and headers installed.
  - Alsa libasound and headers alsa/asoundlib.h installed.

tar zxvf gaw-yyyymmdd.tar.gz
cd gaw-yyyymmdd
./configure
make

If you do not want to embed libasound, try :
./configure --enable-gawsound=no

If you want to disable nls support :
./configure --disable-nls

Putting gaw in gnome menu (on Fedora)
 cp gaw.desktop /usr/local/share/applications
 cp gaw.png     /usr/local/share/pixmaps/

Runnning gaw :
  On command line : gaw
                  : gaw <file to load> ...
                  : gaw -h    for some options

You can get help : leaving the mouse on a button will generate a tooltips.
As it is not possible to get a tooltips on a menu item, messages are
generated in the statusBar. The statusBar is at bottom left corner, and
displays "Welcome to gaw" when you enter gaw. So you should keep one eye on
the statusBar and the other on the menu item. This is difficult for some
people !!!

      Right click on a button in the list window : y @... and select
      Add all similar to selected. This will show al the waves for each
      value of the component.

About data Formats
=================

In principle Gaw is able to recognize the implemented formats, but due to 
the lack of definition in some format, it should be very easy to confuse Gaw.
So it is suggested to provide a format.

There are 2 ways to provide a format :
  - setting the format in the menu for loading a file.
  - giving an extension to your file.
  
The recognized extensions are :
   .tr[0-9], .sw[0-9], .ac[0-9]           for hspice
   .B, .N, .W                             for cazm
   .raw                                   for spice3raw
   .rawspice                              for spice2raw
   .out                                   for nsout
   .wav                                   for wav
   .acd, .acs, .dat, .ascii               for ascii


Requirements for Gaw
====================
 Dependancies :
   Alsa lib >= 1.0.16
   gtk+-2.0 >= 2.10.0
   
Gaw is developped under Fedora But this does not mean, it should not work on
others distributions. Instead it means that if there are mistakes due to
distributions differences, I cannot see them, and you need to report them.
